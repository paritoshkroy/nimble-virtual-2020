<h2>Installing NIMBLE</h2>

<p>NIMBLE is an R package on CRAN, so in general it will be straightforward to install as with any R package, but you do need a compiler and related tools on your system.  </p>

<p>In summary, here are the steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install compiler tools on your system. <a href="https://r-nimble.org/download">https://r-nimble.org/download</a> has more details on how to install <em>Rtools</em> on Windows and how to install the command line tools of <em>Xcode</em> on a Mac. Note that if you have packages requiring a compiler (e.g., <em>Rcpp</em>) on your computer, you should already have the compiler tools installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the <em>nimble</em> package from CRAN in the usual fashion for an R package. More details (including troubleshooting tips) can also be found in Section 4 of the <a href="https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-installing-nimble.html">NIMBLE manual</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3) To test that things are working please run the following code  in R:</p>

<p><code>
library(nimble)
code &lt;- nimbleCode({
  y ~ dnorm(0,1)
})
model &lt;- nimbleModel(code)
cModel &lt;- compileNimble(model)
</code></p>

<p>If that runs without error, you're all set. If not, please see the troubleshooting tips and email nimble.stats@gmail.com directly if you can't get things going.  </p>

<p>In general we encourage you to update to the most recent version of NIMBLE, 0.9.1.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: for those of you using R 4.0 under Windows, you MUST use version 0.9.1.</p>

<h3>Development version(s) of NIMBLE</h3>

<p>Sometimes we make an update or new feature available on a github branch before it is released.  In the event a need arises to install from a branch, you can do so as follows (for branch "devel"):</p>

<p>```
library(devtools)</p>

<p>install_github("nimble-dev/nimble", ref = "devel", subdir = "packages/nimble")
```</p>

<h2>Installing additional packages</h2>

<p>Some of the packages we will use (beyond those automatically installed with <code>nimble</code>) can be installed as follows:</p>

<p><code>
install.packages("mcmcPlots")
</code></p>

<p><code>compareMCMCs</code> is a package in development that is not yet on CRAN:</p>

<p>```
library(devtools)</p>

<p>install_github("nimble-dev/compareMCMCs", subdir = "compareMCMCs")
```</p>
