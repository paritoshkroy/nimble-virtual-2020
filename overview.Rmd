# A few administrative things

## Where to find stuff

The Github site ([https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020)) is the master repository for materials for the modules; you can also get the individual files from Github. 

If you're not familiar with Git, you can get these materials by simply going to [https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020) and click on the 'Download ZIP' button in the right side of the window or simply click [here](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020/archive/master.zip). See also slide 6 in this document for how to get them using Git or from within RStudio.


## Asking questions and making comments

Please ask questions and make comments as we go through the material.

# How we'll operate

The workshop will be organized in modules, each of which will be a combination of lecture/demo presentation. 

# Suggestions on how to get the most out of the workshop

We encourage you to:

- try out the code as we walk through it
-  keep your eyes open! -- We'll illustrate a lot of syntax and concepts by example
- try to guess what the syntax means in cases we haven't yet seen that syntax
- play with it and try variations and try to break it and see what happens
- post a comment on Slack or the Zoom chat if something interesting happens as you experiment
- ask questions!


A few additional thoughts on my pedagogical philosophy here:

- We want to expose you to a lot of tools and ideas that you can come back to when you need them and when you have time for more depth.
- Our aim is not to show you how to use specific statistical methods or analysis techniques. Our goal is to get you up to speed generally in NIMBLE.
- It can be hard to absorb everything in such a concentrated situation. Hopefully the material presented will be useful to you over the longer-term as you do more work with NIMBLE.

# RStudio and R Markdown

We'll present most of the material from within RStudio, using R Markdown documents with embedded R code. R Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that makes it easy to write HTML in a simple plain text format.  This allows us to both run the R/NIMBLE code directly as well as compile on-the-fly to an HTML file that can be used for presentation. All files will be available on [Github](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020).  

Note: The files named *foo_slides.html* have individual slides, while the files named *foo.html* have the same content but all on one page.

Warning: in some cases the processing of the R code in the R Markdown is screwy and the slides have error messages that do not occur if you just run the code directly in R or RStudio. 

# Getting the workshop materials

To download the files, you can do any of the following. 

## From a browser

Simply go to [https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020) and click on the 'Download ZIP' button in the right side of the window or simply click [here](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020/archive/master.zip).

## Within RStudio

Within RStudio go to File->New Project->Version Control->Git and enter:

- "Repository URL": https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020
- "Project Directory Name": nimble-virtual-2020 (or something else of your choosing)
- "Directory": ~/Desktop (or somewhere of your choosing)

Then to update from the repository to get any changes we've made, you can select (from within RStudio):
Tools->Version Control->Pull Branches

or from the Environment/History/Git window, click on the Git tab and then on the blue down arrow.

Be warned that you probably do not want to make your own notes or changes to the files we are providing. Because if you do, and you then do a "Git Pull" to update the materials, you'll have to deal with the conflict between your local version and our version. You probably will want to make a personal copy of such files in another directory or by making copies of files with new names.

## From a terminal window

Run the following commands:

- `cd /directory/where/you/want/repository/located`
- `git clone https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-virtual-2020`

Then to update from the repository to get any changes we've made:

- `cd /directory/where/you/put/the/repository/nimble-virtual-2020`
- `git pull`

# Installing NIMBLE

NIMBLE is on CRAN, so in general it will be straightforward to install, but you do need a compiler and related tools on your system.  

In summary, here are the steps.

1. Install compiler tools on your system. [https://r-nimble.org/download](https://r-nimble.org/download) has more details on how to install *Rtools* on Windows and how to install the
command line tools of *Xcode* on a Mac.
2. Install the *nimble* package from CRAN. 

More details can also be found in Section 4 of the [NIMBLE manual](https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-installing-nimble.html).
